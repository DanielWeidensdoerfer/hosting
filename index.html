    <h1>Chess Coordinate Trainer - Improve Your Chess Notation Skills</h1>
    <p>
        Chess notation is something that every advanced chess player should know. Since we live in a digital age, using
        a software for this is a reasonable idea. Me, being a passionate programmer and also intermediate type of chess
        player, has developed a Chess Coordinate Trainer. Its currently available for web and the android version will
        be published very soon. You can find the web version under www.chesscoordinatetrainer.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Modes</h2>

    <p>There are 2 modes: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notation Training</li>
        <li>Black and White Training</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you wanna learn the notations of the chessboard this is the right place to start. You can choose if you want
        to learn square notation and/or ranks and/or files. Of course you can flip the board to learn the coordinates
        from every perspective.
    </p>

    <p>If you feel comfortable already, you can start the timed mode. Try to hit as many correct notations as possible
        in a certain amount of time.
    </p>


    <p>Black or White Training This mode is about knowing what square notation has which color on the chess board.</p>
